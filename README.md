I see you found my *GitHub*. This is where all my code lives, code that does not quite work yet... but it will someday. 
- I like cats 🐈 
- I practice archery every weekend 🏹
- I practice my programming skills at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com)
- I'm learning Rust 🦀

Anyway you can reach me at [Telegram](https://telegram.me/edfloreshz) if you want to send me your SSH keys and also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edfloreshz) if you want to be up to date with whatever nonsense I tweet 🐦
